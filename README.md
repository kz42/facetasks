# Lightweight Face Tasks

This project focus on lightweight models that can run on mobile devices at real-time speed. Big thanks for [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface). The detection and verification tasks are mostly based on their works. For other references, please check on [Reference](#reference). 

## Introduction

Lightweight Face Tasks mainly focus on how to train the lightweight models that can run on the mobile devices at real-time speed, and some implementations.

I plan to share the experience of how I customized every project based on specific needs. I believe *how to think* is more important than the project itself. Because of this, I welcome your guys to leave any advice or thoughts on [issue](https://github.com/kz42/facetasks/issues), or you can contact me directly. Please check [Contact](#contact) for more information.
